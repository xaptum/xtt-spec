1.  Introduction

   DISCLAIMER: This is a WIP draft and has not yet seen significant
   security analysis.

   The primary goal of the XTT protocol is to provide a secure
   communication channel between an Internet of Things (IoT) device in
   the field and a backend network or server.  The nature of the IoT
   imposes several constraints that differ from traditional transport
   layer security:

   -  Identity Provisioning: IoT devices will be numerous and must be
      low-cost, so manual provisioning of preshared keys (PSKs) or
      client certificates will not scale.  Instead, devices must be
      provisioned long-term cryptographic identities in the field on
      first use.  XTT leverages the Direct Anonymous Attestation [DAA]
      capabilties of modern processors to enable this.

   -  IP Address Mobility: The last-mile Internet access can change
      frequently for IoT devices.  Needing to reestablish the secure
      channel after every IP address change consumes precious energy and

      bandwidth.  XTT decouples the secure channel from the underlying
      TCP/IP or UDP/IP transport socket

   -  DoS Resistance: The secure communication channel is established
      over the public Internet, so the protocol must be designed to help
      the server-side resist denial of service (DoS) attacks.

   The protocol must also provide the following traditional security
   properties:

   -  Mutual Authentication: Both the client and server sides are always
      authenticated.  Server authentication happens via ECDSA and client
      authentication happens via symmetric-key-signature or DAA.

   -  Integrity: Data sent over the channel cannot be modified by an
      attacker.

   -  Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel is visible only to the
      endpoints.  This property is optional; encryption may be disabled
      if the channel is tunneling data that was already encrypted.

   The protocol must resist an attacker with complete control of the
   network, as described in [RFC3552].

   XTT consists of three primary components:

   -  An identity provisioning protocol (Section 3.2) used by the device
      to request an identity from the server and establish a long-term
      shared secret.

   -  A session establishment protocol (Section 3.3) that (TODO) (1
      par.) describe this protocol

   -  A record protocol (Section 4) that (TODO) (1 par.) describe this
      protocol

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used:

   client: The initiator in a handshake.

   connection: A transport-layer connection between client and server,
   over which XTT traffic is sent.

   endpoint: The physical device that is acting as either client or
   server during communication.

   handshake: An initial negotiation between client and server for
   either provisioning authorization data to the client or establishing
   shared cryptographic information for subsequent communication.

   identity: A universally-unique tag used to identify a client to a
   server or to any other clients that may be peers.

   server: The responder in a handshake.

   session: A collection of cryptographic parameters and secrets used
   for secure communication.

1.2.  Use Cases

   (TODO)

1.3.  Design Goals

   (TODO)

   -  Small, fixed-size messages during handshake

      o  No arbitrary-length certificate chains

1.4.  Security Requirements for the IoT

   (TODO) How IoT security differs from old world.  What are the unique
   requirements.

1.4.1.  Differences from (D)TLS

   -  Heavyweight (heavy use of bandwidth during handshake)

   -  Designed around one-way, not mutual, authentication

   -  Non-confidential communication of identities during handshake

   -  Security session tied to connectivity session

      o  Having to re-run handshake every time underlying connection/IP
         changes compounds bandwidth problem

1.4.2.  Differences from QUIC

   -  Security session tied to connectivity session

   -  Not designed for mutual authentication

   (TODO) (1 list) what QUIC doesn't offer that IoT requires

1.4.3.  Differences from IKE/IPSec

   -  Pushing data requires performing full Two-Round-Trip handshake
      first

   -  Protects identity of server, not client, which is the opposite of
      what's needed in IoT

   -  Very complex to configure, and easy to get wrong

   (TODO) (1 list) what IKE doesn't offer that IoT requires

1.4.4.  Differences from Double-Ratchet-based Protocols

   -  Per-message key updating is too heavy for most IoT, which doesn't
      require per-message forward secrecy

   -  Doesn't address identification (uses trust on first use)

   (TODO) (1 list) what Double-Ratchet doesn't offer that IoT requires

1.4.5.  Differences from Noise

   -  Designed mainly for either pre-shared (or statically-known) keys,
      or for unauthenticated communication

   (TODO) (1 list) what Noise doesn't offer that IoT requires

1.4.6.  Differences from MinimaLT

   -  Requires a highly-available directory service for name-lookup
      (unnecessary in IoT)

   -  Reliable-transport only (can cause issues on lossy networks
      commonly encountered in IoT)

   -  User-level authentication is inappropriate for IoT (devices aren't
      multi-user)

2.  Protocol Overview

   The XTT protocol provisions shared, secret state between a client and
   a server that may persist past the lifetime of the underlying
   connection.  This shared state is grouped into two classes:

   -  A long-term identity for a client and the shared secrets used to
      prove that identity to the server during future communication

   -  A session consisting of cryptographic material to be used for
      message authentication and confidentiality

   A client requests an identity from a server using the handshake shown
   in (Figure 1) and described in (Section 3.2).  To complete the
   handshake, the client must prove its membership in a client group
   recognized by the server, using a Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)
   signature.

      Figure 1: Message flow for XTT Identity Provisioning Handshake

   Once a client possesses an identity, it authenticates that identity
   to a server and negotiates a session, using the handshake shown in
   (Figure 2) and described in (Section 3.3).  The cryptographic
   parameters and materials negotiated during the session-establishment
   handshake allow the client and server to protect (check
   authentication and integrity, and optionally encrypt) application
   layer traffic using a record-level protocol also shown in (Figure 2)
   and described in (Section 4).

3.  Handshake Protocols

   The XTT protocol includes two handshake protocols: an identity-
   provisioning protocol, and a session-establishment protocol.

   The messages defined below are given to the underlying transport-
   layer as-is (i.e. there is no further framing).  A handshake MUST be
   completed within a single underlying connection with the same
   physical endpoint.

3.1.  Common Messages

   Both handshake protocols begin with the same two messages: the
   ClientInit and the ServerInitAndAttest.

3.1.1.  ClientInit

   A client initiates a handshake with a ClientInit message.  This
   message determines the parameters (version and cryptographic
   algorithms) of the subsequent handshake, provides a nonce for the
   server to sign (to prevent replay attacks of this handshake), and
   communicates the client's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public key.

   Structure of this message:

   struct {
       MsgType type = client_init;
       Version version;
       SuiteSpec suite_spec;
       SigningNonce nonce_c;
       DHKeyShare dh_keyshare_c;
   } ClientInit;

3.1.2.  ServerInitAndAttest

   Upon receiving a ClientInit message, and assuming the version and
   suite_spec are acceptable, a server responds with a
   ServerInitAndAttest message.  This message confirms the version and
   suite_spec, communicates the server's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public
   key, authenticates the server's identity, and provides the client
   with a ServerCookie.  This ServerCookie is used to prevent replay
   attacks against the server, and to challenge the client's return-
   routability.

   The ServerCookie also allows a server implementation to refrain from
   storing any local state until the client proves return-routability;
   see (Appendix D.2).

Internet-Draft                     XTT                          May 2017


   The message is AEAD-protected (using the algorithm specified in the
   suite_spec) using the "server_handshake_send_key" and
   "server_handshake_send_iv".  The "signature_s" and "certificate" are
   created as described in (Section 6.6.1).

   Structure of this message:

   aead_struct<server_handshake_send_keys>(
       MsgType type = server_init_and_attest;
       Version version;
       SuiteSpec suite_spec;
       DHKeyShare dh_keyshare_s;
   )[
       ServerCertificate certificate;
       ServerSignature signature_s;
       ServerCookie server_cookie;
   ] ServerInitAndAttest;

3.2.  Identity Provisioning Protocol

   This handshake provisions an identity to a client, along with the
   shared secrets necessary for the client to prove possesion of the
   identity.  A successful identity-provisioning handshake is required
   before a client may perform a session-establishment handshake.

3.2.1.  ClientIdentity_ClientAttest

   Once a client receives a ServerInitAndAttest message during an
   identity-provisioning handshake, and assuming the ServerInitAndAttest
   is correctly validated (MAC and signature are verified, and version
   and suite_spec correspond to those sent in the ClientInit message),
   the client responds with a ClientIdentity_ClientAttest message.  This
   message echoes the ServerCookie (to prove return-reachability),
   authenticates the client's membership in an authorized group, and
   requests to be provisioned an identity.

   A client may indicate a specific ClientID in the "id_c" field of a
   ClientIdentity_ClientAttest message, in order to request that
   specific ClientID be provisioned to it.  Otherwise, if the client
   wishes the server to select the ClientID for it, the "id_c" field
   MUST be set to all zeroes.

   The message is AEAD-protected (using the algorithm specified in the
   suite_spec) using the "client_handshake_send_key" and
   "client_handshake_send_iv".  The "daa_signature_c" is created as
   described in (Section 6.6.3).

     ClientID id_c;                  /* all zeroes if not specific id */
     DAASignature daa_signature_c;
 ] ClientIdentity_ClientAttest;

3.2.2.  ClientIdentity_ServerFinished

   Once a server receives a ClientIdentity_ClientAttest message, and if
   that message is validated (message authentication code and client
   signature verified, and version and suite_spec are acceptable), the
   server responds with a ClientIdentity_ServerFinished message.

   The ClientIdentity_ServerFinished message informs the client of the
   ClientID that has been provisioned to it (either echoing the same
   "id_c" requested in the ClientAttest message or sending the newly-
   provisioned id if "id_c" was all zeroes).  In addition, the
   ServerFinished message contains a hash of the successful handshake,
   authenticated using a key derived from the LongtermSecret that has
   been provisioned.  This is to provide 'peer-awareness' to the client,
   so the client and server can confirm they have the same view of the
   provisioned ClientID and LongtermSecret.

   The message is AEAD-protected (using the algorithm specified in the
   suite_spec) using the "server_handshake_send_key" and
   "server_handshake_send_iv".  The "awareness_proof" is given by
   "identity_awareness_proof", as described in (Figure 4).

3.3.  Session Establishment Protocol

   This handshake negotiates a session (cryptographic secrets used for
   secure communication), and requires that a ClientID has been
   provisioned for this client via a previous identity-provisioning
   handshake.  A successful session-establishment handshake is required
   before a client may securely communicate via the record-layer
   protocol.

3.3.1.  Session_ClientAttest

   Once a client receives a ServerInitAndAttest message during a
   session-establishment handshake, and assuming the ServerInitAndAttest
   is correctly validated (MAC and signature are verified, and version
   and suite_spec correspond to those sent in the ClientInit message),
   the client responds with a Session_ClientAttest message.  This
   message echoes the ServerCookie (to prove return-reachability),
   proves the client's ownership of the claimed ClientID, and requests
   to be provisioned a SessionID.

   A client may indicate a specific SessionID in the "session_id" field
   of a ClientAttest message, in order to request that specific
   SessionID be provisioned to it.  Otherwise, if the client wishes the
   server to select the SessionID for it, the "session_id" field MUST be
   set to all zeroes.

   The message is AEAD-protected (using the algorithm specified in the
   suite_spec) using the "client_handshake_send_key" and
   "client_handshake_send_iv".  The "signature_c" is created as
   described in (Section 6.6.2).

    SymmetricSignature signature_c;

3.3.2.  Session_ServerFinished

   Once a server receives a Session_ClientAttest message, and if that
   message is validated (message authentication code and client
   signature verified, and version and suite_spec are acceptable), the
   server responds with a Session_ServerFinished message.

   The Session_ServerFinished message informs the client of the
   SessionID that has been provisioned to it (either echoing the same
   "session_id" requested in the Session_ClientAttest message or sending
   the newly-provisioned SessionID if "session_id" was all zeroes).  In
   addition, the ServerFinished message contains a hash of the
   successful handshake, authenticated using a key derived from the
   cryptographic secrets that have been provisioned.  This is to provide
   'peer-awareness' to the client, so the client and server can confirm
   they have the same view of the provisioned secrets necessary for
   secure communication.

   The message is AEAD-protected (using the algorithm specified in the
   suite_spec) using the "server_handshake_send_key" and
   "server_handshake_send_iv".  The "awareness_proof" is given by
   "session_awareness_proof", as described in (Figure 5).

   Structure of this message:

   aead_struct<session_keys>(
       MsgType type = MsgType.session_serverfinished;
       Version version;
       SuiteSpec spec;
   )[
       SessionID session_id;   /* confirm session_id */
       AwarenessProof awareness_proof;
   ] Session_ServerFinished;

3.4.  Behaviors Common to Both Handshake Protocols

   A client may resend a ClientInit if it has not received a
   ServerInitAndAttest in response within a timeout period.  There is no
   requirement that ClientInit retries be identical, as long as a client
   only responds to one ServerInitAndAttest response.

   When responding to a ClientInit message with a ServerInitAndAttest, a
   server MAY store all necessary state in the ServerCookie embedded in
   the ServerInitAndAttest and save no state locally.

   A server MAY respond to multiple ClientInit messages from the same
   client with not-necessarily identical ServerInitAndAttest messages
   before a full handshake is completed with that client.  However, if

   multiple ClientInitAndAttest replies are sent to the same client
   during a handshake and the server is storing state locally after
   responding (rather than storing state only in the ServerCookie), the
   server MUST ensure that response to any one of the
   ClientInitAndAttest is valid.

   If a client times-out waiting for a ServerFinished response to its
   ClientAttest message, the client MUST resend identical ClientAttest
   messages during the handshake, or else abort the handshake.  If
   multiple non-identical ClientAttest messages are sent during the same
   handshake, the client's and the server's view of the shared secret
   material negotiated during the handshake will differ, and
   communication will be impossible.

   A client MUST wait until successful receipt of a ServerFinished
   message before initiating a session-establishment handshake.

   If a server receives a ClientAttest message from a client from which
   it has already received a ClientAttest message during this handshake,
   the server MUST ignore the the extra messages.

4.  Record Protocol

       MsgType type = MsgType.record_regular;
       Version version;
       SessionID session_id;

       MsgLength length;
   )[
       EncapsulatedPayloadType payload_type;
       byte payload[length - sizeof(rest_of_message)];
   ] Record_Regular;

5.  Error Handling

   (TODO)

6.  Cryptographic Computations

6.1.  Notation

   The cryptographic computations used in this protocol make use of a
   pseudo-random function "prf", defined as:

Internet-Draft                     XTT                          May 2017


   prf<N>(Key, Input) =
       Keyed pseudo-random function (set during handshake),
       keyed by "Key", with "Input" as input, outputting "N" bytes

   The "prf" is implemented by a keyed hash function.  For the case of
   the SHA512-based suite_spec options, "prf" is HMAC, as specified in
   [RFC2104], using SHA-512, defined in [SHS], as the underlying hash
   function.  For the case of the BLAKE2b-based suite_spec options,
   "prf" is the BLAKE2b keyed-hash function, as defined in [RFC7693].

   In addition, a non-keyed hash, denoted "hash", will be referenced
   here.  For the SHA512-based suite_spec options, this is just SHA-512.
   For the BLAKE2b-based suite_specs, this is Blake2b with a zero-length
   key.

   The hashes used in the cryptographic computations described below use
   a construction denoted "hash_ext", which appends the input length to
   its input before hashing:

   hash_ext(Input) =
       hash(
           struct {
               uint16 length = Input.length;
               byte input[<input.length>] = Input;
           };
       )

   Similarly, "prf_ext" is defined as the "prf" function with the output
   length appended to its input:

   prf_ext<N>(Key, Input) =
       prf<N>(Key,
              struct {
                  uint16 out_length = N;
                  byte input[<input.length>] = Input;
              };
       )

6.2.  Transcript Hashes

   The computation of the shared secret materials requires various
   hashes of the handshake messages, in order to bind these secret
   materials to the specific handshake.  The definitions of these hash
   values follow below.

   When included in a hash, handshake messages are unencrypted.

6.3.  Key Calculation and Schedule

   Multiple secret materials are derived from the same input key by
   including different handshake context into the call to "prf".  These
   contexts are defined in Table 1 below, and their use is shown in
   Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5.

6.4.  ECDHE Parameters

   The size and interpretation of a value of type DHKeyShare depends on
   the Diffie-Hellman algorithm specified in the handshake messages.

   Currently, only x25519 is supported by the protocol.

   For x25519, the contents are the byte string inputs and outputs of
   the corresponding functions defined in [RFC7748].  The size of the
   DHKeyShare in this case is 32 bytes.

6.5.  DAA Parameters

   (TODO)

   EPID2, TPM2.0, and FIDO key/signature sizes.

6.6.  Signature Algorithms

   The size and interpretation of signature types (signatures and public
   keys) depends on the signature algorithm.

6.6.1.  ServerSignature

   Currently, the only supported algorithm for the server's signature in
   a ServerInitAndAttest is an EdDSA signature (described in [RFC8032])
   using the X25519 elliptic curve (this combination is known as
   Ed25519).

   For Ed25519, the contents of ServerSignaturePublicKey are the byte
   string output of the key generation described in [RFC8032], where the
   byte string format is defined in [RFC7748].  Similarly, the content
   of ServerSignature are the byte string output of the signature
   algorithm of [RFC8032] in the format of [RFC7748].

6.6.2.  SymmetricSignature

   (TODO)

6.6.3.  DAASignature

   (TODO)

6.7.  Per-message Nonce Calculation

   A per-session pair of key and IV are created for both sending and
   receiving data, upon the successful completion of a handshake.  The
   client and server each get a pair of sending and receiving keys/IVs
   (of course, the server's sending key/IV matches the client's
   receiving key/IV, and vice-versa).  The byte-length of the IVs is
   that of the nonce for the negotiated AEAD algorithm.

   At the start of a new session (after a successful handshake), the two
   sequence numbers (client-to-server and server-to-client) are set to
   0.  The first record-level payload the client sends after sending its
   Session_ClientAttest must have sequence number 0.  Similarly, the
   first record-level payload sent by the server after sending its
   Session_ServerFinished must have sequence number 0.

   A per-message nonce is generated before AEAD encryption by left-
   padding the sequence number (in network byte order) to the length of
   the nonce/IV, then XOR'ing the appropriate IV with this padded
   sequence number.

7.  Security Considerations

   Both XTT handshake protocols are based on the SigMA family of
   authenticated key exchange protocols, which is also the basis for
   signature-based authentication in the Internet Key Exchange version 2
   (IKEv2) protocol [RFC7296] used in the IPSec protocol suite.
   Specifically, the XTT protocol uses the SigMA-I variant described in
   [SIGMA].  In particular, note that the present protocol does not
   place the MAC under the signature, as is done in IKEv2 (this is
   referred to as variant (ii) in [SIGMA]).  A formal security analysis
   of the SigMA protocols can be found in [SIGMASEC].

   The handshake protocols are authenticated Diffie-Hellman key
   exchanges.  Both protocols require four messages.  The server, who is
   always the responder in a handshake, sends the final message to
   provide the client "peer awareness" (proving to the client that the
   server is alive and agrees on the results of the handshake).  The
   client, who is always the initiator of a handshake, may choose to
   begin pushing traffic with the third message of a session-
   establishment handshake, before receiving the peer awareness response
   from the server.  The reason for requiring a full roundtrip before
   application traffic is allowed (in contrast to the 0-RTT option
   proposed for the upcoming TLSv1.3 standard) is to protect against
   replay attacks.

   The handshake protocol protects the confidentiality of the client's
   identity from both passive and active attackers, while protecting the
   server's identity from passive attackers; in IoT, client identities
   are more likely to be sensitive than server identities.  Assuming at
   least one side (client or server) produces new Diffie-Hellman key
   pairs for each handshake, the protocol also provides forward secrecy.

Appendix B.  Presentation Language

B.1.  Miscellaneous

   Comments begin with "/\*" and end with "\*/".  Concatenation of byte
   strings is denoted "||"

   To indicate the number of bytes taken up in the byte stream by a type
   or value, the expression "sizeof(value-or-type)" is used.

   Optional components are denoted by enclosing them in "[[ ]]" double
   brackets.

B.2.  Definition of Byte

   One byte is defined to be 8 bits.  Multiple-byte data items are
   concatenations of bytes, from left to right, from top to bottom.

B.3.  Byte Arrays

   A byte-array is a single-dimensional array of bytes of given fixed
   length.  The syntax for specifying a new type, "Tp", that is a byte-
   array of length "n" is

   byte Tp[n];

   Here, "Tp" occupies "n" bytes in the data stream.  The length of the
   vector is not included in the encoded stream.

   An anonymous byte array is specified by not including a new type
   name: "byte[n]" indicates space of n bytes in the byte stream.  This
   is useful for constructed and variant types.

   Unless defined as a numeric data type, the bytes comprising a byte-
   array are not to be interpreted by the protocol in any way.

Internet-Draft                     XTT                          May 2017


B.4.  Numeric Data

   A type defined as an n-byte numeric value indicates that the byte
   stream is interpreted (using C notation) as:

   numeric_value = (byte[0] << 8*(n-1)) | (byte[1] << 8*(n-2)) |
           ... | byte[n-1];

   This byte ordering for multi-byte values is the commonplace network
   byte order or big-endian format.  The pre-defined numeric types
   uint8, uint16, uint32, and uint64 are defined as

   byte uint8[1];
   byte uint16[2];
   byte uint32[4];
   byte uint64[8];

   For example, the uint32 value given by the bytestream "01 02 03 04"
   is interpreted as the decimal value 16909060.

B.5.  Enumerateds

   To indicate a type that may take values only from a fixed set of
   possible values, a new type may be defined as of type "enum".  Each
   definition of an enumerated type is a different type.  Only
   enumerateds of the same type may be assigned or compared.  Every
   element of an enumerated must be assigned a value.

   The possible values of an enumerated type are specified in this
   document using numeric values.  To indicate how to interpret a value
   of an enumerated type, and to indicate how much space in the byte
   stream is occupied by an enumerated type, the definition of the
   enumerated type includes the underlying numeric type used to define
   its values.

   Implementations that receive a value of an enumerated type that is
   not in the set of possible values for that type MUST reject the
   containing message and handle the error as specified for that message
   type.

   The following example defines an enumerated type called Color that
   has three possible values, which are represented in the byte stream
   as uint16 values (thus a value of type Color occupies 2 bytes in the
   byte stream)

Internet-Draft                     XTT                          May 2017


   enum : uint16 {
       Red(0x1234),
       Green(9),
       Blue(60000)
   } Color;

   The names of the elements of an enumerated type are scoped within the
   defined type, and a reference in this document to the value of a name
   is always given by the fully-qualified form "Type.Name".  Thus a
   reference to the "Color" value "Blue" from above is given by
   "Color.Blue".

B.6.  Constructed Types

   Complex types may be constructed from primitive types, using the
   "struct" construction.  Each constructed type defines a new type.

   The following example defines a constructed type called "T", which
   comprises two subfields "f1" and "f2"

   struct {
       T1 f1;
       T2 f2;
   } T;

   A value of type "T" would occupy a total of "sizeof(T1) + sizeof(T2)"
   bytes in the byte stream.

   Subfields of a constructed type are referenced in this document by
   "Type.subfield" when referring to the field in the general type
   "Type", and by "name.subfield" when referring to the field in a
   specific value named "name".  Thus, the value of the subfield "f2" in
   a value called "foo" of type "T", from the example above, would be
   referenced as "foo.f1".

B.7.  AEAD-Encrypted Constructed Types

   Encryption and authentication of all messages in this protocol are
   done using Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD)
   [RFC5116].  To indicate that a constructed type is processed using an
   AEAD algorithm, the following notation is used:

   aead_struct<key_set>(
       addl1;
       addl2;
       ...
       addlN;
   )[
       enc1;
       enc2;
       ...
       encN;
   ] T;

   In this example, the type "T" consists of the unencrypted subfields
   "addl1" through "addlN", and the encrypted subfields "enc1" through
   "encN".  The keys (encryption key, authentication key, and nonce)
   used is given by "key_set".  The entire struct is authenticated.
   Note that the total length in the byte stream of a value of type "T"
   is the size of an authentication tag (determined by the chosen AEAD
   algorithm) in addition to the sum of the sizes of its subfields.

B.8.  Constants

   Fields and variables may be assigned a fixed value using "=".  In the
   following example, all values of type "T" would always have "T.c"
   equal to "Color.Blue"

   struct {
       Color c = Color.Blue;
       T2 f2;
   } T;

B.9.  Variants

   Defined structures may have variants based on some knowledge that is
   available within the environment.  The selector must be an enumerated
   type that defines the possible variants the structure defines.  There
   must be a case arm for every element of the enumeration declared in
   the select.  Case arms have limited fall-through: if two case arms
   follow in immediate succession with no fields in between, then they
   both contain the same fields.

   The mechanism by which the variant is selected at runtime is not
   prescribed by the presentation language.

   For example:

   uint8 SubT1;
   uint16 SubT2;
   struct {
       select (color_in) {
           case Color.Red:
               SubT1;
           case Color.Green:
           case Color.Blue:
               SubT2;
       } variant_field;
   } VariantStruct;

   In this example, it is assumed the creation of a value of type
   "VariantStruct" requires the input of a parameter called "color_in"
   of type "Color".  When creating a value of type VariantStruct with
   name S, if "color_in" is "Red" then the subfield "S.variant_field" is
   of type "SubT1".  Alternatively, if "color_in" is either "Green" or
   "Blue", "S.variant_field" is of type "SubT2".  Note that the size of
   the type "VariantStruct" depends on the value of "color_in" at the
   time of construction.

Appendix D.  Implementation Notes

D.1.  Distributed Servers and Proxies

   Because the identity and session may be long-lived and are not tied
   to the underlying network connection, the protocol makes no
   requirement that a client only communicate with a single physical
   server endpoint during the lifetime of an identity or session.  A
   common use case is of multiple server endpoints that share long-term
   storage, all aware of the state shared with a client endpoint.




Beckwith & Bild         Expires November 23, 2017              [Page 32]

Internet-Draft                     XTT                          May 2017


   Similarly, the protocol makes no requirement that the physical
   endpoint that completes the identity-provisioning handshake be the
   same physical endpoint to which this identity is given.  For example,
   a proxy capable of producing DAA signatures may request multiple
   distinct identities for the distinct endpoints behind it.

D.2.  Server Cookie and DoS Attacks

   Server implementation MAY refrain from storing local state after
   responding to a ClientInit, and instead store state in the
   ServerCookie.  Either way, the implementation MUST have a means of
   authenticating an ServerCookie echoed back to a server as being
   generated by that server and of checking that the ServerCookie has
   not been seen by that server before.  One possible implementation of
   this is to AEAD encrypt the cookie with a key known only to the
   server and rotated frequently: upon receiving a cookie, the server
   checks that the cookie can be decrypted with a recent key, proving
   authenticity and freshness, and remembering that cookie has having
   been seen (only cookies generated using the recent key need be
   remembered), proving uniqueness.

D.3.  Underlying Transport Protocol

   (TODO) Notes on fragmenting, ordering, etc.

D.4.  Cryptographic Requirements

   (TODO) Requirements for identity-provisioning handshake, for session-
   establishment handshake, and for record-level communication.
